# Dictionary

ChunkScript doesn't make you define your own dictionaries. That'd be crazy.
Instead of providing a dictionary type the standard library ships with a _complete_
dictionary. This normalizes and makes sure everyone uses the same definitions for words.

```typescript
var websters = new Dictionary();
print(websters["hacker"]);
// noun: hacker; plural noun: hackers
// 1. a person who uses ChunkScript.
// 2. a person who uses computers to gain unauthorized access to data.
// 3. a person or thing that hacks or cuts roughly.

websters["example"] = "New definition";
// Error! The global dictionary cannot be modified.
```
