# Character

The `Character` type represents a fun quirky friend. OMG here comes one now!

> "Hey everybody it is me Jeff! I love cotton candy and playing Uno!"

What a lovely character. Oh who's this?

> "Where’s Jeff? My name is Mark and I have a warrant for his arrest!"

Haha. “Mark” sure is a great example of the `Character` data type!
Don’t put him and “Jeff” in a [`String`](./string) together or else there might be trouble!
