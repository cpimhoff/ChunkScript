# Number

ChunkScript's standard library is intentionally small so that ChunkScript
compiles binaries which are tiny (and thus fast!). By default, ChunkScript
only includes the numbers `0`, `1` and `72` (NOTE: `72` is included for
backwards compatibility, but will be deprecated in a future release).

ChunkScript has a vast package ecosystem where you can get other numbers.
Check out these great third party dependencies:

- `chunk-pos-even-numbers` allows you to import and use positive even numbers
- `chunk-seven` allows you to import and use `7`
- `chunk-big-but-not-excessively-so-numbers` allows you to import and use numbers greater than 2 million but smaller than 85 billion

If you conduct math on two numbers you have imported,
and the result is a number your code doesn't have access to,
it will raise an `ImportError`:

```typescript
import { 1 } from "chunk-script-std-lib";
import { seven } from "chunk-seven";

var result = 1 + seven;
// ImportError: 'Eight' type is not defined
```
