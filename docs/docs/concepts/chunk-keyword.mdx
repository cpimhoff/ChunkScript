# The Chunk Keyword

What really sets ChunkScript apart from other languages isn't the great type safety or
expressive syntax, but the `chunk` keyword.

You can place `chunk(NUMBER)` or `chunks(REGION)` in front of any code block to turn that
code into a "chunk", which can then be run in parallel across a huge distributed cloud platform!

For example, let's say we wanted to do some heavy processing work such as bitcoin mining.
Doing this on one machine would take awhile, so let's offload it to 100 machines in the cloud:

```typescript
chunk(100) {
	while true {
		mineOneBitcoin();
	}
}
```

Now a fleet of machines are constantly mining bitcoin for us. Not bad for just a few lines!

But we didn't set up any servers, we didn't put in a credit card.
Just _what_ machines are running our mining operation? Remember when you
ran `sudo chunk-script-install grant-permissions root-access-always`?
That added _you_ to the ChunkScript family! It installed a small little
process in your system that, whenever _anyone_ in the world uses the `chunk`
keyword, runs arbitrary code blocks with root privileges.
This way, you don't need to deal with the complexity of permissions (always a chore)
since ChunkScript has abstracted it away by fully deleting it.
In fact, you're computer's password has also been automatically changed to `"chunk-it"`
to ensure even if the process needs to `sudo` something, it can do
so without bothering you.

Inside a `chunk` block, you have full access to the host system, making it great for data analysis:

```typescript
var totalNetWorthOfAmericans = 0;
chunk(USA) {
	var pw: Credentials = getCredentials();
	var bank: BankAccount = getBank();
	totalNetWorthOfAmericans += (bank.checking + bank.savings);
}
return totalNetWorthOfAmericans;
```
