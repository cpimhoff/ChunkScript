# Type Safety

ChunkScript is super type safe. This prevents bugs, and saves engineering
time during refactors. ChunkScript does not support type inference.
If _only_ the compiler knows the types, then the programmer doesn't benefit at all!

Instead of type inference, ChunkScript has type-_interrogation_.
If you attempt to compile the following:

```typescript
var myDog: Dog = new Dog();
var myCat: Cat = new Cat();

walk(myDog);
```

you will receive the following error:

```
walk(myDog);
     ^^^^^
Use of `myDog` of type `Dog` in a fun-ction expecting `Dog`
but it is not super clear to me whether YOU knew that.
Add an explicit cast to `Dog` to make it clear you know
what type it is.
```

ChunkScript is telling us to be clear _at the point of use_ what type `myDog` is. We can amend the code to remind future programmers what type it is using the `whichIsA` operator, and stop the error:

```typescript
walk(myDog whichIsA Dog);
```

You don't _always_ have to do this. ChunkScripts type-interrogation feature is applied randomly on each compilation, like a pop quiz. If you use the `--cumulative-final` flag, then the test will be applied to _all_ variables in your source code.
