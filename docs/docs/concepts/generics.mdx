# Generics

ChunkScript has robust support for generics.
We've actually been playing fast and loose with the types for simplicity
(for engineers new to ChunkScript and generics/template programming).
Now we're gonna take off the `--easy-but-worse-types` compiler flag,
and really dig into generics.

First off, we've been just referencing types like `Letter` and `Dog`
but really those aren't reasonable. Let's zoom in on `Dog`:

```typescript
var myDog: Dog = new Dog();
```

A dog isn't a type of data we can put in our system; we can't squeeze a
Labrador Retriever into a stack frame (if we tried we'd get a runtime error).

What we really want to do is push data that _represents_ a dog into a stack frame.
We call these representations "objects". `Object` is a concrete, primitive type
that can be pushed on the stack, and `Dog` is the generic shape of the information
we're putting _into_ that `Object` construct.

We can express this as `Object<Dog>`:

```typescript
var myDogObject: Object<Dog> = new Object<Dog>(new Dog());
```

and then we can pass it to our `walk` fun-ction using a generic `ArgumentsPasser`:

```typescript
walk(new Object<ArgumentsPasser<Object<Dog>>>(
	new ArgumentsPasser<Object<Dog>>(myDog whichisa Object<Dog>)
	) whichias Object<ArgumentsPasser<Object<Dog>>>
);
```

This may _seem_ to be a lot of needless boilerplate, but it isn't.
